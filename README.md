### Projects

#### Chip â€“ The Smart Payment Solution for CuraÃ§ao

Played a key role in developing **Chip**, an e-wallet designed to streamline financial transactions for users in CuraÃ§ao. The app allows users to manage various financial tasks like paying bills, transferring money, and shopping online with ease. As a front-end developer, I worked on both the Android and iOS versions, ensuring a smooth, user-friendly experience and successfully publishing the app on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chip-wallet/id6479026465) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chip.curacao&pli=1).

#### Pendulum â€“ Exclusive Event Management Application

Contributed to the development of **Pendulum**, a members-only event management platform that offers exclusive access to premium events in fashion, art, sports, and music across the globe. As part of the development team, I enhanced user engagement features and streamlined the event discovery process, allowing members to receive invitations to nearby events and gain early access to tickets. Pendulum grants its elite clientele privileges like guest list access, bespoke shopping experiences, and attendance at in-house curated events. Available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pendulum-members/id6476434974).
